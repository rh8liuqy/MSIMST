Description: A Bayesian monotonic single-index mixed-effect model incorporating a multivariate skew-t likelihood with survey weights adjustments. This package includes a simulation program and the associated Gibbs sampler. The single-index function is modeled as a monotonic increasing function, with a tailored Gaussian process prior to ensure accurate estimation. Random effects are assumed to follow the canonical skew-t distribution, while residuals are modeled using the multivariate Student-t distribution. Additionally, the package provides Bayesian adjustment for survey weight information.
